*** Known issue: GUI seems to update one step behind calculation ***
-hard to figure out what's going on - need to figure out how to do this with simpler robot
-pretty sure collision_detection.py in_collision method was buggy
  when we implemented it with max_distance=margin=0

08/24/22:
-have (supposedly) since fixed in_collision by using max_distance=SMALL_VAL
-TODO: need to double check in_collision for correctness later on
-TODO: what happens if robot collides with itself? Will consider this case later
