*** Known issue: GUI seems to update one step behind calculation ***
-hard to figure out what's going on - need to figure out how to do this with simpler robot
-pretty sure collision_detection.py in_collision method was buggy
  when we implemented it with max_distance=margin=0

08/24/22:
-have (supposedly) since fixed in_collision by using max_distance=SMALL_VAL
-TODO: need to double check in_collision for correctness later on
-TODO: what happens if robot collides with itself? Will consider this case later
-TODO: add command line options to simulator, predictor
-when I change the robot possible positions, accuracy changes
-TODO: need to generate possible diagrams

08/26/22:
-boundary points seem to be most difficult to predict: include uncertainty score?
-do no-repeat sampling to prevent duplicates?

09/06/22:
-making obstacles more complex (and having multiple) slightly decreases
  accuracy, but still in mid-90s
-increasing number of points does increase accuracy
-on 100,000 points: sampling takes 26 seconds, ML takes only 1 second with 99% accuracy

09/14/22:
-for now, deep learning doesn't work for basic point-by-point interpolation, but can try to generate map from picture of scene"
